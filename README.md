Creating two requests for two different endpoints

The code is using the Locations API from ACCU Weather to locate the city location, using the City Search code to get to the City Information

Then, the code accesses the second endpoint using the Current Conditions API from ACCU Weather.

We send the city code, to the Current Condition API. From where we recive back information on the Current Condition in the City that was typed in the input.
